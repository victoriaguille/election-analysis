# Election Analysis
## Project Overview
#### Two employees of the Colorado Board of Elections have been tasked with performing an election audit of a recent local congressional election using Python 3.6.1 and Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1. While performing the election audit, the election commission requires the results to be broken down into a simple report with the results displayed by both candidates and counties. The election results data, stored in a text file, are much too large and cumbersome for any one person to go through by hand, resulting in the need for Python. The Python code, being written and run in Visual Studio Code, is then used to pull the necessary information using lines of code. This method made going through the original CSV file with the election results possible. Using the new lines of Python code, we are able to print the audit results to the terminal and save them to a text file. 

## Election Audit Results 
#### Below are the following findings from the audit. 
    - There were ____ votes cast in the elections. 
    -The counties involved in the election results were:
        - Arapahoe

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
